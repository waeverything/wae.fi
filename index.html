                <p>2015 -</p>

                <p>A server made in partnership with WAEverything and The Fishpire. Server died due to insufficient

                <p>While not directly under the WAEverything umbarella. mc.j3.fi was the predecessor and foundation to
                    which the Holisti server was built upon.</p>

                <p>Died with the public one.</p>
                <p>Season that never saw the light of day somewhere in 2017. Nipde completely accidentally built Turun
                    tuomiokirkko there right to the spawn. Luckily J3_rmu spotted this mistake after the church was
                    built.</p>

                <p>2019 - 2019</p>

                <p>Random human experiment for an anarchy server. It wasn't meant to be public but somehow it got
                    public. The details are a little foggy what happened with that one.</p>

                <p>2019 - 2020</p>

                <p>WAEverything's Public Minecraft Server's predecessor that Fabian was running for couple of years. The
                    server was meant to be a small private Minecraft server that quickly grew in both terms of
                    playerbase and scope.</p>
                <p>In 2020 AvocadoCraft was dropped in favor of running the WAEverythings' new public server.</p>

                <p>Crushed by deadlines, sleep deprived but somehow Nipde made it in time. We even had a trailer made
                    and posted to our Youtube channel. It was fun the month or so that it lasted. The server died while
                    updating the pack and a wild memory leak appeared.</p>

                <p>2019 - 2019</p>

                <p>A project that Nipde worked on passionately. WAE Tech was supposed to be a Modpack where you could
                    turn the world into a wasteland with the machines (and tech) you have if you are not careful. When
                    reaching the critical waste point a sub-modpack would activate unlocking a post apocalyptic
                    elements.</p>
                <p>Biggest elements were RP, cars, guns and own versions of some custom worlds. There were even ideas
                    like portals and stranger things thrown out there. We had main menus and everything ready, but the
                    bigger content was still unimplemented and ultimately the project ended before reaching it's public
                    state.</p>
